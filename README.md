# Personal Settings

Various personal settings. Better VCS than Google Drive!

For people who aren't me, the [shell aliases](https://github.com/cooperka/personal-settings/tree/master/shell) will likely be the only useful things here. I recommend taking a look; there is a separate README there with more details.
